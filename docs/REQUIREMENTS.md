# üöÄ Project Requirements: Simple Website Group Project

Welcome! This document outlines the requirements for your collaborative group project. The goal is to build a simple, functional website from scratch, applying the foundational web development skills you've learned.

---

## üéØ 1. Project Overview

This is a **collaborative group project**. Your team will build a simple website for **Kopli Couture**, a unique venue that is a vintage ex-USSR vibe-inducing clothes shop by day and a cocktail bar by night. The site should capture this dual retro/modern identity and serve as a hub for local artists and vintage fanatics.

The website will consist of a **Home Page**, an **About Page**, and an **Events & Contact Page**.

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Core Technologies & Constraints

The project must adhere strictly to the following technical stack. The goal is to master the fundamentals.

* **Version Control:** üêô Git must be used for all code management.
* **Code Repository:** üìÇ The entire project must be hosted in a **publicly accessible repository** on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
* **Hosting:** üåê The final, live website must be deployed and accessible on **`kodu.ut.ee`**.
* **Languages:** üìú The website must be built using **HTML** and **CSS**. **JavaScript** is required for achieving the highest grade.
* **Frameworks:** üö´ The use of pre-built frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, React, Vue) is **strictly forbidden**. This project is a "vanilla"-only zone. You must write your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.

## ‚úÖ 3. Minimum Requirements for Grading

To be eligible for a grade, your project must satisfy all of the following minimum requirements.

* [ ] **Version Control:** The project uses Git, and its history is publicly available in a repository.
* [ ] **Deployment:** The completed project is successfully deployed and is live on `kodu.ut.ee`.
* [ ] **Technology:** The website is built using only HTML and CSS (and optionally JavaScript), without any external frameworks.
* [ ] **Documentation:** A project wiki or `README.md` exists and contains all the required information (see Section 4).

> [!WARNING]
> Failure to meet **any** of these minimum requirements will result in a **failing grade (0 points)** for the project. No exceptions.

---

## üìù 4. Project Documentation (Wiki / README.md)

Your project repository **must** include a comprehensive wiki or a detailed `README.md` file. This is a graded component of your project.

Your documentation must contain the following sections:

* **Project Purpose:** A clear description of your website. What is its topic? What is its primary goal?
* **Team Members:** A list of all members of the project team.
* **Division of Labor:** A clear and specific breakdown of responsibilities. Who was responsible for which parts of the project?
  * *Example: "Jane Doe: HTML structure for the homepage & about page. John Smith: All CSS styling and the JavaScript for the interactive photo gallery."*

## üíØ 5. Grading Criteria

Your project will be graded out of a total of **10 points**. The final code present on the **`main`** (or `master`) branch of your repository is the only code that will be considered for grading. Ensure all completed work is merged accordingly.

Click on each criterion below to see the detailed point breakdown.

<details>
<summary><strong>Content, Scope, and Functionality (2 points)</strong></summary>

* **2 pts:** Project includes a home page and at least two functional sub-pages. All interactive elements (links, videos, forms, JS objects) are well-implemented, correctly positioned, and fully functional.
* **1.5 pts:** A home page and at least two sub-pages exist. Some elements (e.g., layout, links) may not be positioned or function correctly.
* **1 pt:** A home page and one sub-page exist. Contains at least one image, but the overall project feels incomplete.
* **0 pts:** No website submitted, or only a single, empty page exists.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Visual Design and Consistency (1 point)</strong></summary>

* **1 pt:** The website is visually cohesive, aesthetically pleasing, and presents a polished, unified experience across all pages. The design is spectacular, unique, and well-executed.
* **0.5 pts:** The design is mostly consistent, but a few elements do not fit the overall style of the website.
* **0 pts:** No website submitted, or the design is highly inconsistent and disjointed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>JavaScript Implementation (1 point)</strong></summary>

* **1 pt:** JavaScript is meaningful and adds dynamic or interactive value in the context of the website's content. The code is well-commented in **Estonian**, and all external code is properly cited (including if the author is a team member from another project).
* **0.5 pts:** JavaScript is present and correctly linked. The code includes comments in **Estonian**. Proper citation is provided for any code not written by the team.
* **0 pts:** No JavaScript is used, the script file is not linked correctly, or the code is not commented.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code Validity (HTML & CSS) (2 points)</strong></summary>

* **2 pts:** The code is completely free of validation errors according to the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
* **1.5 pts:** The code has only a single, difficult-to-trace "mysterious" error.
* **1 pt:** The code has a few validation errors.
* **0 pts:** The code has numerous and varied validation errors.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code Structure and Organization (2 points)</strong></summary>

* **2 pts:** The project demonstrates excellent file organization. A common CSS file is used for shared styles. Each page with a unique style has its own separate CSS file. JavaScript is located in its own dedicated file (e.g., `scripts/main.js`).
* **1.5 pts:** CSS is in a separate file, but styles are unnecessarily duplicated, or a single CSS file is used for all pages despite them having different layouts.
* **1 pt:** CSS is partially or entirely written inline within the HTML files (i.e., using `<style>` tags or `style` attributes).
* **0 pts:** No code submitted.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Project Documentation Quality (1 point)</strong></summary>

* **1 pt:** An exemplary wiki/README is provided that clearly and thoroughly details the project purpose, team members, and division of labor as specified in Section 4.
* **0.5 pts:** The wiki/README is incomplete or missing one of the required sections.
* **0 pts:** No wiki or README is provided.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Version Control (Git Branching Strategy) (1 point)</strong></summary>

* **1 pt:** An exemplary branching strategy was used. Work was developed on separate feature branches (e.g., `feature/contact-page`, `fix/navbar-css`) and then merged into the main branch upon completion.
* **0.5 pts:** All commits were made directly to a single branch (e.g., `main`).
* **0 pts:** The project is not in a repository.

</details>

## ü§ù 6. Contribution Policy

> [!NOTE]
> All team members are expected to contribute equitably to the project. In cases of significant imbalance, the grades of individual team members who have contributed less may be adjusted downwards. A clear and accurate **"Division of Labor"** section in your documentation is essential for fair assessment.
